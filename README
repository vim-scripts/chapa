Allows you to move to previous/next class, function or method 

toggle comments or visually select the next/previous class, function or method. 

Currently supports Python, JavaScript and Ruby

Usage                                 
There are a couple of routes you can take: with or without default mappings.

If you want to define your own mappings then no need to do anything else other than know the actual plugin calls (listed below).

If you want the default mappings (also listed below) you need to add this to your vimrc:

let g:chapa_default_mappings = 1
You can map those callables to anything you want, but below is how the defaults are mapped:

" Function Movement
nmap fpf <Plug>ChapaNextFunction
nmap Fpf <Plug>ChapaPreviousFunction

" Class Movement
nmap fpc <Plug>ChapaNextClass
nmap Fpc <Plug>ChapaPreviousClass

" Method Movement
nmap fpm <Plug>ChapaNextMethod
nmap Fpm <Plug>ChapaPreviousMethod

" Class Visual Select
nmap vanc <Plug>ChapaVisualNextClass
nmap vic <Plug>ChapaVisualThisClass
nmap vapc <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousClass

" Method Visual Select
nmap vanm <Plug>ChapaVisualNextMethod
nmap vim <Plug>ChapaVisualThisMethod
nmap vapm <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousMethod

" Function Visual Select
nmap vanf <Plug>ChapaVisualNextFunction
nmap vif <Plug>ChapaVisualThisFunction
nmap vapf <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousFunction

" Comment Class
nmap cic <Plug>ChapaCommentThisClass
nmap cnc <Plug>ChapaCommentNextClass
nmap cpc <Plug>ChapaCommentPreviousClass

" Comment Method
nmap cim <Plug>ChapaCommentThisMethod
nmap cnm <Plug>ChapaCommentNextMethod
nmap cpm <Plug>ChapaCommentPreviousMethod

" Comment Function
nmap cif <Plug>ChapaCommentThisFunction
nmap cnf <Plug>ChapaCommentNextFunction
nmap cpf <Plug>ChapaCommentPreviousFunction

" Repeat Mappings
nmap <C-h> <Plug>ChapaOppositeRepeat
nmap <C-l> <Plug>ChapaRepeat
If the requested search (function, class or method) is not found, the call simply returns and nothing should happen. However, there is an error message that should display by default, explaining what it was supposed to search and in what direction.

You can disable this by adding a chapa-specific variable in your vimrc:

let g:chapa_messages = 0
You can also add a "count" to repeat the match N times. So if you want to go to the 3rd previous class you would (with the mappings above) do something like:

3Fpc
The same applies for visual selections. If you want to visually select the 3rd next method, you would do it like:

3vanm
You can also toggle comments of a given class, method or function. To comment the next class:

cnc
If the class is already commented, the command above will remove the comments.

If you are moving around, the plugin allows you to repeat the forward or reverse (opposite to the original) move. For example, if you searched for the next function like:

fpf
Then <C-l> repeats that same command for you and moves you in the same direction. If you want to go in the opposite movement, then <C-h> is your friend.
