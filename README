Allows you to move, comment or visually select the  previous/next class, function or method 

There are a couple of routes you can take: with or without default mappings.

If you want to define your own mappings then no need to do anything else other 
than know the actual plugin calls (listed below).

If you want the default mappings (also listed below) you need to add this to 
your vimrc::

    let g:chapa_default_mappings = 1

You can map those callables to anything you want, but below is how the 
defaults are mapped::

   " Class Movement
   nmap fpc <Plug>ChapaNextClass
   nmap Fpc <Plug>ChapaPreviousClass

   " Method Movement
   nmap fpm <Plug>ChapaNextMethod
   nmap Fpm <Plug>ChapaPreviousMethod

   " Function Movement
   nmap fpf <Plug>ChapaNextFunction
   nmap Fpf <Plug>ChapaPreviousFunction

   " Class Visual Select 
   nmap vanc <Plug>ChapaVisualNextClass
   nmap vic <Plug>ChapaVisualThisClass 
   nmap vapc <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousClass

   " Method Visual Select
   nmap vanm <Plug>ChapaVisualNextMethod
   nmap vim <Plug>ChapaVisualThisMethod
   nmap vapm <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousMethod

   " Function Visual Select
   nmap vanf <Plug>ChapaVisualNextFunction
   nmap vif <Plug>ChapaVisualThisFunction
   nmap vapf <Plug>ChapaVisualPreviousFunction

   " Comment Class
   nmap cic <Plug>ChapaCommentThisClass
   nmap cnc <Plug>ChapaCommentNextClass
   nmap cpc <Plug>ChapaCommentPreviousClass

   " Comment Method 
   nmap cim <Plug>ChapaCommentThisMethod 
   nmap cnm <Plug>ChapaCommentNextMethod 
   nmap cpm <Plug>ChapaCommentPreviousMethod 

   " Comment Function 
   nmap cif <Plug>ChapaCommentThisFunction
   nmap cnf <Plug>ChapaCommentNextFunction
   nmap cpf <Plug>ChapaCommentPreviousFunction


If the requested search (function, class or method) is not found, the call simply 
returns and nothing should happen. However, there is an error message that should 
display by default, explaining what it was supposed to search and in what 
direction.

You can disable this by adding a chapa-specific variable in your vimrc::

  let g:chapa_messages = 0

You can also add a "count" to repeat the match N times. So if you want to go 
to the 3rd previous class you would (with the mappings above) do something like::

  3Fpc

The same applies for visual selections. If you want to visually select the 3rd
next method, you would do it like::

  3vanm
