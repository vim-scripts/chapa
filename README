A very simple VIM plugin to visually select a Python Function or Class


Installation couldn't be easier: drop the plugin file in your vim plugin 
directory.

I would highly recommend you use something like Pathogen though, it 
makes dealing with VIM plugins way easier.

1. Intro                                 

After trying other plugins that were supposed to achieve this objective (and 
fail) I decided to write it on my own. 

The initial approach is to be able to simply have a visual selection of a 
Python Class or Function.

No need to have VIM compiled with Python support since this plugin uses 
pure VIM syntax.

2. Usage                                

Straightforward (for now). Chapa has 2 public calls that you can map to 
anything you want. If you had a leader mapping, it woul look similar to 
this::

    nmap <Leader>c <Esc>:ChapaVisualClass <CR>
    nmap <Leader>f <Esc>:ChapaVisualFunction <CR>

When either is called, it goes to the start of the selection and starts a 
visual block until indentation no longer applies.

If the requested search (function or class) is not found, the call simply 
returns and nothing should happen.
